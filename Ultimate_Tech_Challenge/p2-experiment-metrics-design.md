## Part 2 ‐ Experiment and metrics design

The neighboring cities of Gotham and Metropolis have complementary circadian rhythms: on weekdays, Ultimate Gotham is most active at night, and Ultimate Metropolis is most active during the day. On weekends, there is reasonable activity in both cities.However, a toll bridge, with a two way toll, between the two cities causes driver partners to tend to be exclusive to each city.
The Ultimate managers of city operations for the two cities have proposed an experiment to encourage driver partners to be available in both cities, by reimbursing all toll costs.

### 1. What would you choose as the key measure of success of this experiment in encouraging driver partners to serve both cities, and why would you choose this metric?

#### Metric:
% increased number of drivers who cross both cities during the day or the night.

#### Rationale for the metric:
The main objective in reimbursing tolls is to encourage drivers to work in both Gotham and Metropolis. Measuring how many actually do so captures whether the toll reimbursement removes the friction effectively.


### 2. Describe a practical experiment you would design to compare the effectiveness of the proposed change in relation to the key measure of success. Please provide details on:
### a) how you will implement the experiment

#### Designing and implementing the experiment:
1.  Determine the duration of the experiment.
2.  Determine the sample size or population. Only include drivers who operate in the either of those two cities.
3. Randomly assign drivers to either the control group or the treatment group. Ensure balance and elimination of biases.

> - Control group will continue to pay the toll fees and remain status quo.
> - Treatment group's toll fees shall be reimbursed 100% during the entire trial period.

4. Track the number of drivers in the Treatment group who operates in both cities for the entire duration of the experiment. Capture data on the number of crossings and traffic at all times.


### b) what statistical test(s) you will conduct to verify the significance of the observation

#### Statistical Tools:
Use a Chi-square test to compare the proportion of drivers who operate in both cities. Calculate the proportion from both treatment group and control group.

> H0: No difference between the two groups\
> HA: Treatment group has higher participation/crossings

### c) how you would interpret the results and provide recommendations to the city operations team along with any caveats.


#### Interpreting the outcomes:

If there's a statistically significant increase in the participation/crossings esp within the treatment group, devise ways to effectively roll out the implementation of reimbursible toll. On the other hand, if there's no significant difference, the toll cost may not be the underlying factor in the friction and the management should start looking at other possible factors or conduct a different experiment. A survey among the participants could provide insights and would be helpful in understanding underlying causes.

#### Recommendations:

If the trial yields favorable outcome, expand or broaden reimbursement or incentive programs when crossing both cities. Monitor the crossings/behavior and observe continuity or changes esp when the incentives are removed.

If unsuccessful, explore alternative incentive programs. Price surges for cross-city trips might encourage drivers to cross. Gamification or rewards programs to further encourage crossings and driver engagement.
